# Creating your own sprites for usin my Mapbox GL JS

# Sprites cannot be added to code simply by pointing to a svg file.  Mapbox requires a specific json and png of sprites.  There is a tool that makes it quite simple to create this.

1 Create your svg icon 
2 Use spritezero to generate the json and png file
3 Create your own copy of mapbox styles 
4 add the file path to your sprites
5 eh voila
